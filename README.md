# E-commerce Data Analysis Project
<br>
This project focuses on analyzing factors contributing to customers being classified as return customers in an e-commerce setting. The analysis aims to help e-commerce businesses understand the key drivers behind customer retention and improve their marketing and operational strategies accordingly.

Project Overview
In this project, we explored an e-commerce dataset to:

Analyze customer behavior patterns.
Identify features that indicate a customer is likely to return.
Build a predictive model to classify return customers.
The steps followed include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development.

Dataset
The dataset consists of e-commerce transactional data, including information on customer purchases, demographics, and engagement metrics.

Key features include:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Purchase History: Details of the customer's past purchases.
Engagement Metrics: Information on customer interactions with the e-commerce platform (e.g., website visits, app usage).
Demographics: Data about customers' age, location, and other relevant details.
Key Objectives
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Identify key trends and patterns that differentiate return customers from one-time customers.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) metrics to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Development: Build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict customer return likelihood.
Methods Used
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalizing numerical features, and one-hot encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of trends using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.
Feature Engineering: Derived new features like recency and frequency of purchases to capture customer behavior.
Machine Learning Models: Used models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to classify return customers.
Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Results
Best Model: The best-performing model was [Model Name], achieving an accuracy of [X]% and an F1 score of [Y]% on the test data.
Key Findings:
Recency and frequency of purchases were strong indicators of customer retention.
Demographics such as customer location also played a significant role in predicting return customers.
Conclusion
This project successfully identified key factors influencing customer retention in e-commerce and built a robust predictive model. These insights can help e-commerce companies improve customer retention strategies
